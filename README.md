# MazeSolver
Robbie the robot is on a reconnaissance mission.  He must find all possible routes through a maze and report back to his (benevolent-ish) human overlords.  

The maze consists of an n x n grid, consisting of # symbols, which represent walls, and assorted letters, [a...z] representing the stones along the path (i.e. where Robbie can travel).  It is possible that these letters might repeat, but there will never be two of the same letters side by side.  The Rules of the Maze: ...are about as simple as could be!  There is exactly one entrance to the maze, but there may be multiple exits.  To simplify your life, all mazes will start one down from the upper left corner, and will always be labeled with an uppercase S. Exits could be anywhere along the right-most wall.  The top wall and bottom walls are always solid rows of # symbols.  Robbieâ€™s moves are restricted such that he can only move to an adjacent square that contains a letter, and he cannot walk through (or on) walls.  Robbie must exit as soon as he can (that is, if there are two side-by-side exits, he will always take the first exit he encounters).You must produce a list of all valid paths through the maze.
